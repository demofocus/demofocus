## Hi there, I'm demofocus ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer learning on-the-job on the Roblox platform. I originally joined Roblox on November 21st 2012 and I attended multiple events including Bloxcon and RDC!

Over the years I have gained experience in sword clans, trading, QA testing and now developing. My contributions amount to a solid 700M+ visits overall.

I've held high profile roles in groups such as [Trade.](https://www.roblox.com/communities/650266/Trade#!/about), [The Sky Clan of Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/communities/129425/The-Sky-Clan-of-ROBLOX#!/about) and most major sword clans of the early-mid 2010s.
